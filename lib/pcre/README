This version of PCRE was stripped down to its bare essentials,
comes with static chartables, config.h, pcre.h, and direct
autotools integration into this project's build environment.
The object archive libpcre.a is built, and statically linked
into the UV Navigator binary.

This makes UV Navigator more portable, especially to non-Unix
platforms, and eases cross-compiling a lot.
